    <h1>Team Statter Docs</h1>
    <h2>v1.0.2</h2>
    <p>Team Statter is a one page web application that displays Ranked 5's Team match statistics using charts.
        The user can see charts based on their average performance or each match in the team's match history. Just pick your
        region, enter your Summoner Name, and choose one of your Ranked Teams.

    </p><h3>
        What makes Team Statter unique?
    </h3>

    Most match-history stat viewing apps are targeted at improving solo queue performance, where Team Statter is
    specifically targeted at 5v5 Ranked Teams. The goal of the app is to help players, coaches, and analysts of 5's
    Teams to figure out what the strengths and weaknesses of the team are, using real data. The type of statistics I've
    chosen to display either are not available in the league client match history, or do not require the opposing team's
    stats to get meaningful information. <p></p>

    <h3>To-Do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement request-delaying for when receiving too many requests, rather than requiring the user to re-click the team.</li>
        <li>Make legend into clickable button to allow the user to toggle each team members data on the chartm</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1.0.2 - Added documentation, redesigned footer links.</li>
        <li>1.0.1 - User interface revamped, requests now stored in local storage for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>1.0.0 - Basic User Interface, charts, and request system complete.</li>
    </ul>

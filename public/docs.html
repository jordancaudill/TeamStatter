    <h1>Team Statter Docs</h1>
    <h2>v1.1.2</h2>

    <p>Team Statter is a one page web application that displays Ranked 5's Team match statistics using charts.
        The user can see charts based on their average performance or each match in the team's match history. Just pick your
        region, enter your Summoner Name, and choose one of your Ranked Teams.

    </p><h3>
        What makes Team Statter unique?
    </h3>

    <p>
    Most match-history stat viewing apps are targeted at improving solo queue performance, where Team Statter is
    specifically targeted at 5v5 Ranked Teams. The goal of the app is to help League of Legends teams figure out what the strengths and weaknesses of the team are, using real data. The type of statistics I've
    chosen to display either are not available in the league client match history, or do not require the opposing team's
    stats to get meaningful information.</p>

    <h3>To-Do</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>UX and UI changes based on user feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>FAQ</h3>
        <em>Why are all the stats "per minute"?</em>
        <p>To avoid stat inflation caused by game duration. For example, matches with longer durations can make it seem as though your team did really well on CS (creep score) if you look at the total amount of minions killed for the match. By showing the stat on a "per minute" basis, we get a better idea of how consistently each player was killing minions over all matches. The same goes for other stats.</p>
